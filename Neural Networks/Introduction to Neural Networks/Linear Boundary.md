# Linear Boundary Lines
```
 Ý => Wx + b = 0
```
where, 
    Ý = Predection
    w = weights (w1, w2)
    x = inputs (x1, x2)
    b = bias

# Higher Dimension
If we have 3 dimension, still we can use
Wx + b = 0
but this we have 3 weight

W <sub>1</sub>X<sub>1</sub> + W<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> + W<sub>3</sub>X<sub>3</sub> + b = 0

If we have n dimension
```
W1X1 + W2X2 + WnXn + b = 0 
```
