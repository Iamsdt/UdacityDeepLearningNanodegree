# Perceptron

A Perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. This algorithm enables neurons to learn and processes elements in the training set one at a time.

# Perceptron at a Glance

Perceptron has the following characteristics:

- Perceptron is an algorithm for Supervised Learning of single layer binary linear classifier.
- Optimal weight coefficients are automatically learned.
- Weights are multiplied with the input features and decision is made if the neuron is fired or not.
- Activation function applies a step rule to check if the output of the weighting function is greater than zero.
- Linear decision boundary is drawn enabling the distinction between the two linearly separable classes +1 and -1.
- If the sum of the input signals exceeds a certain threshold, it outputs a signal; otherwise, there is no output.

Types of activation functions include the sign, step, and sigmoid functions.



### Introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957



# Function

Perceptron is a function that maps its input “x,” which is multiplied with the learned weight coefficient; an output value ”f(x)”is generated.

In the equation given above:

“w” = vector of real-valued weights

“b” = bias (an element that adjusts the boundary away from origin without any dependence on the input value)

“x” = vector of input x values

“m” = number of inputs to the Perceptron

The output can be represented as “1” or “0.”  It can also be represented as “1” or “-1” depending on which activation function is used.

Let us learn the inputs of a perceptron in the next section.



# Types of Logic gate

- AND
- NAND
- OR
- NOR
- NOT
- XOR
- XNOR



**AND**

If the two inputs are TRUE (+1), the output of Perceptron is positive, which amounts to TRUE.

**OR**

If  either of the two inputs are TRUE (+1), the output of Perceptron is positive, which amounts to TRUE.

**XOR**

A XOR gate, also called as Exclusive OR gate, has two inputs and one output.

The gate returns a TRUE as the output if and ONLY if one of the input states is true.

XOR Truth Table

| **Input** | **Output** |      |
| --------- | ---------- | ---- |
| A         | B          |      |
| 0         | 0          | 0    |
| 0         | 1          | 1    |
| 1         | 0          | 1    |
| 1         | 1          | 0    |
