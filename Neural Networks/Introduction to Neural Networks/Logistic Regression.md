# Logistic Regression

The **logistic regression** technique involves dependent variable which can be represented in the binary (0 or 1, true or false, yes or no) values, means that the outcome could only be in either one form of two. For example, it can be utilized when we need to find the probability of successful or fail event. Here, the same formula is used with the additional sigmoid function, and the value of Y ranges from 0 to 1. Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.

## Key Differences Between Linear and Logistic Regression

1. The Linear regression models data using continuous numeric value. As against, logistic regression models the data in the binary values.
2. Linear regression requires to establish the linear relationship among dependent and independent variable whereas it is not necessary for logistic regression.
3. In the linear regression, the independent variable can be correlated with each other. On the contrary, in the logistic regression, the variable must not be correlated with each other.

# Calculating the Error Function

For binary classification:

For multiclass classification:

Where, m = number of classes.

Both are same, if there is two classes
