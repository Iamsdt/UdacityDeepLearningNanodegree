# Matrix

# Types of Dimensions
### Scalars
- zero dimension
Example: 0.1, 2, 3 or a persion height

### Vectors
- List of valus
- 1 Dimension
- Two types
    - Row vector, Exp: (list store in row) 
    - Column Vector, Exp: (List store in column)

### Matrices
- two dimentional grid of values
[1, 2, 3
 3, 4, 5 ]

 ### Tensors
- n dimension collection of values

# Important Reminders About Matrix Multiplication
- The number of columns in the left matrix must equal the number of rows in the right matrix.
- The answer matrix always has the same number of rows as the left matrix and the same number of columns as the right matrix.
- Order matters. Multiplying A•B is not the same as multiplying B•A.
- Data in the left matrix should be arranged as rows., while data in the right matrix should be arranged as columns.

# Matrix Transpose
a matrix with the same values as the orginal but it has the rows and columns switched.
